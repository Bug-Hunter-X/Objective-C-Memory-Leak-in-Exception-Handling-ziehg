This corrected code uses an `@finally` block to ensure that `myObject` is released, even if an exception occurs. The `@finally` block is always executed, providing a reliable way to release resources and prevent memory leaks.

```objectivec
@try {
    MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    // ... some code that might throw an exception ...
    [myObject doSomething];
} @catch (NSException *exception) {
    NSLog("Exception caught: %@", [exception reason]);
} @finally {
    [myObject release]; //Ensure object is released in all cases
}
```
